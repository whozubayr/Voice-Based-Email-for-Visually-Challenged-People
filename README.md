# Voice-Based-Email-for-Visually-Challenged-People
 Voice based Email service for visually challenged people.The inception of the internet has dramatically revolutionized many fields, including communication. One of the main ways in which the internet has revolutionized communication is through email, which is considered to be the most reliable way to send or receive important information over the internet. However, there is a criterion for humans to access the internet: the ability to see. While everyone with eyes can see, there are also individuals in our society who are not gifted with this ability, such as visually challenged or blind people who cannot see things and therefore cannot see the computer screen or keyboard. To address this issue, it is possible to develop a voice-based email service that allows visually impaired individuals to access and use email through voice commands, using text-to-speech and speech-to-text technology to convert email messages and user input into spoken words and vice versa.
